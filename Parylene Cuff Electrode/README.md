The Parylene C cuff electrode is designed for branch nerves less than 1mm in diameter. Design, fabrication, and testing are performed at USC at the [Biomedical Microsystems Laboratory](http://biomems.usc.edu/) of Dr. Ellis Meng.

Please see the [Design](https://github.com/CARSSCenter/Device/tree/main/Parylene%20Cuff%20Electrode/Design) folder for design files and the [Fabrication and Packaging](https://github.com/CARSSCenter/Device/tree/main/Parylene%20Cuff%20Electrode/Fabrication%20and%20Packaging) folder for fabrication instructions (beginning with the "Full Fabrication Protocol", which references the "Thin Film Fabrication Protocol").

All mask designs are included in a single DXF file as separate layers (metal, electrodes+edge, edge only)
- DXF units are microns
- The overall mask size is 5" x 5" square for lithography on a 4" wafer
- Designs are summarized in the accompanying PDF
- Built in AutoCAD 2022 S.51.0.0

All 3D renderings do not include metal patterning (only the Parylene backbone is modeled)
- STEP units are millimeters
- SLDPRT files include three configurations: flat (prior to thermoforming), 0.5 or 0.7 mm (thermoformed size), and 0.8 or 1.0 mm (largest implanted size)
- Built in SolidWorks Professional 2019 SP5.0
