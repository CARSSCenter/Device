All mask designs are included in a single DXF file as separate layers (metal, electrodes+edge, edge only)
- DXF units are microns
- The overall mask size is 5" x 5" square for lithography on a 4" wafer
- Designs are summarized in the accompanying PDF
- Built in AutoCAD 2022 S.51.0.0

All 3D renderings do not include metal patterning (only the Parylene backbone is modeled)
- STEP units are millimeters
- SLDPRT files include three configurations: flat (prior to thermoforming), 0.5 or 0.7 mm (thermoformed size), and 0.8 or 1.0 mm (largest implanted size)
